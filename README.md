## Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL
### Tech Stack Used
SQL
### About the Project
This project explores the COVID-19 dataset using SQL to extract meaningful insights. It covers various aspects such as total cases, deaths, death rates, vaccination status, and country-wise trends. The dataset has been cleaned and analyzed using advanced SQL techniques, such as CTEs, Joins, Views, and Temporary Tables, to facilitate better understanding and visualization of the data.

### Features of the Project
✔ Data Cleaning – Converts string-based numerical fields into proper data types for accurate calculations.
✔ Total Cases vs Total Deaths Analysis – Identifies the severity of the pandemic by calculating death percentages.
✔ Country-Specific Insights – Focused study on India, including death rates and case trends.
✔ Population Impact Analysis – Determines the highest infection and death rates across different regions.
✔ Time-Based Trends – Identifies the first occurrence of deaths and tracks daily new cases.
✔ Vaccination Analysis – Examines vaccination progress in different locations using SQL joins.
✔ Use of SQL Views and CTEs – Optimized query execution for efficient data retrieval.

### Advantages / How It Helps
✅ Helps in understanding COVID-19 trends using SQL-based analysis.
✅ Provides country-specific and global insights into the pandemic.
✅ Aids policymakers and health organizations in making data-driven decisions.
✅ Enhances SQL proficiency with real-world data analysis.

### Usage Instructions
Import the dataset (COVIDDEATHS and COVIDVACC) into your SQL environment.
Execute the provided SQL queries sequentially to analyze the data.
Modify queries as per requirements to extract custom insights.
Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains COVID-19-related data on cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
